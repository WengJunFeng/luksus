#################### LUKSUS ############################
############ EASY DRIVE ENCRYPTION SCRIPT ##############
########################################################
################# GENERAL INFORMATION ##################
########################################################

#
# The purpose of this script is to provide an easy eay to encrypt
# storage media in Linux, such as hardrives, usb sticks, 
# sd cards or external hardrives.
# Why? Because doing all these tasks manually is 
# time consuming, and the procedure is hard to remember.

# DISCLAIMER 
# (this script might be used in the US, I have 
# to put this disclaimer here)
#
# I, the author, take no responsibility if a black hole appears,
# and implodes your house, your town and the entire planet earth as an
# effect of using this script.
# Understand that the author takes no responsibility, and cannot
# be held liable if you, the user, use the script to destroy the
# files/contents of your storage media.
# As a consequence it is the sole responsibility of the user
# to use this software correctly. The author cannot be held
# liable for any damages, as of this disclaimer.
#
# On a bright note, I, the author, have never experienced problems
#with it, the program.


# This is a wrapper script for cryptsetup, shred and mkfs
# I like doing it this way instead of using luksformat
# which I didn't know existed at the time when I began
# creating LUKSUS.

# The script works like this:
# all existing data will be brutally removed beyond reconstruction (forensically)
# then it writes random data to the drive
# then creates a keyfile
# then encrypts the drive using the keyfile stored in /keys
# a LUKS header backup will also be placed in /keys
# please
# remember to take care of your /keys
# if you loose your /keys, the keyfile to your encrypted drive, then
# the data will be impossible to retrieve.

# USAGE:
# ./luksus DEVICENAME NICKNAME-of-luks-container
#
# EXAMPLE:
# ./luksus /dev/sdb1 rambo1
#
# if running remotely, for instance via ssh, it makes a lot of sense
# to run this in screen, just append screen to the command
#
# EXAMPLE:
# screen ./luksus /dev/sdb1 rambo

# REQUIREMENTS:
# full attention of the user
# an empty hardrive or storage media
# knowledge about which device the hardrive or storage
# blkid will provide this
# media resides on
# cryptsetup
# dialog
# shred

# this script works on Linux
# but could potentially also work on other LUKS enabled
# OS'es, like FreeBSD.

# Luksus is released under GNU GPLv2 License

# I would love to hear from you regarding suggestions
# tips and so on. My email is: thomas .at. aftenstorm.com

#################### TODO ##############################
########################################################

# + add a nice dialog interface
# + must be escapable - ie. have a CANCEL button within 
#   the dialog windows
# + add a nice ARE YOU SURE sequence
# + clean up script, make it more modern
# + rewrite the script using python
# + include more conditional arguments to make
#   it more elegant

########################################################
#################### CHANGELOG #########################
########################################################
#
# vCURRENT
# + improved documentation (README file)
#
#
# v0.5 25.04.2012 12:30
# + initial public release
#   live on github here: https://github.com/thomasfrivold/luksus
#   (yay)
# + massive cleanup
# + added a conditional check to verify that user is root
# + added a conditional check in the middle of the procedure to
#   verify that a LUKS container has been created on the device
#   good for integrity 
# + added a routine to hackup the luks header with a conditional
#   check as suggested by the luks FAQ
#   here: http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#6._Backup_and_Data_Recovery
# + fixed mounting procedure
#   changed name of the script from cryptcreate to luksus
#   the luksus name is more a pun than a functional name
#   luksus means luxury in Norwegian and coincidentally it includes the main technology
#   used to encrypt hardrives in Linux since the 2.6 kernels - Linux Unified Key Setup
#   on a celebratory note, the script can now be considered stable. Even though
#   it lacks some niceties such as a fully fledged ncurses dialog menu system
#   which is aimed at version v1.0
#   - Thomas Frivold 

# v0.4
# + cleaned up script
# + added required runtime arguments

# v0.3
# + added command line input

# v0.2
# + cosmetic fixes
# + did some nice thinking about dialog

# v0.1 16.04.2012 GMT+1 1320
# + initial release
